## General
Docker container running the original P1 Monitor from https://www.ztatz.nl/p1-monitor/

P1 Monitor is software project to run smart metering monitoring on a Raspberry Pi. The telegrams received from the smart meter are continously being processed and visualised on a web page. Additionally it provides options to read information from solar panels directly (Solar Edge specifically) do accounting, get (historic) overviews etc.  Since the original P1 Monitor software is only available to run as a dedicated Operating System on a Raspberry Pi this repository contains the software ported to use it in a containerised environment. Most of the original software is reused but some specific container functions have been modifies/added/removed.

## More information and usage
Guide, latest updates, release notes and usage of the container: https://marcel.duketown.com/p1-monitor-docker-versie/ 
Original software: https://www.ztatz.nl/p1-monitor/ (Dutch language) 

## Start the container
Best way to start the container is using the included docker-compose file. That way your instance will also automatically start again after a host reboot
Run the container using the following run command:

    docker-compose up -d

## Docker repository
A docker image is available from docker hub at https://hub.docker.com/r/mclaassen/p1mon. An example docker-compose is included mapping external port 81 to the container.

##  Internet exposure
Note that although the UI provides a password protected interface you should not expose it publicly to the internet without addional security measures. The password is intended to protect changes to the system, not to protect the system from e.g. exfiltrating data

## Updating
Shut down the container using 'docker-compose down' and use 'docker-compose pull' to update to the latest image version. Start the container as mentioned above

## Migrate
Copy files from a previous version (1.2.0 or later on docker) in the defined 'alldata' directory (see included docker-compose file) in subdirectory 'data' (alldata/data). The import function is also fully functional to migrate from Raspberry Pi to docker
